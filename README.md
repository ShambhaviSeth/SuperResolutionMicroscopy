# Super-Resolution Microscopy using Diffusion Models

## Introduction
In microscopy, resolution is traditionally defined as the minimal distance at which two distinct points can be differentiated. Conventional optical microscopy is restricted by the diffraction limit of light, approximately 200-300 nm. Super-resolution microscopy (SRM) techniques aim to bypass this limit, achieving resolutions as small as 20 nm, thereby allowing researchers to study intricate biological structures such as proteins, small organelles, cellular membranes, neural connections, and even molecules.

While SRM techniques provide unparalleled visualization of subcellular structures, they also present challenges in selecting the most appropriate method for a given research objective. In recent years, advancements in deep learning, particularly diffusion models, have demonstrated the potential to further enhance super-resolution imaging.

## Problem Statement
**Enhance cell images using super-resolution techniques, leveraging the latest advancements in generative AI models, particularly diffusion models, to outperform traditional SRM approaches.**

## Importance
Super-resolution microscopy plays a critical role in biological and medical research, allowing scientists to study cellular structures at the nanoscale. However, existing methods come with limitations in terms of computational efficiency, accessibility, and ease of implementation. By integrating diffusion models into SRM, we aim to improve image quality while reducing the need for costly experimental procedures.
